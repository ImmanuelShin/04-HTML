            <h2>Wake UP</h2>
            <p>The year is 2023 and your phone wont stop buzzing. Random notifications from ten different social media apps never stop pestering your attention span. You tell yourself that you can look away whenever you want, but your eyes are glued stuck to the small screen in your hands. News posts and memes pop up one after another: <i>Trump did something crazy</i>; <i>Another Covid variant has been discovered</i>; <i>California replaces water with drinkable wildfires</i>; <i>Local lady finds lost armadillo</i>. You look up when you hear a faint shout. A random new video has auto-played on your laptop while you weren't looking. You have no idea what you are watching. You look at the time for the first time in hours; It's 11 pm. Turning back to your phone, you swipe away the notifications and close out of the app you are currently in. "<i>Time for a break</i>"", you think. The app gives way to your home screen where you immediately tap on a different social media app. You start scrolling.<br><i>Bzzt</i>. A text from your friend. They show you a post that you have already seen. You shoot back a laughing emoji. Back to scrolling. "<i>I should get ready for bed</i>." This is the 8th time you have thought this, and the 8th time's the charm. You stand up. Your legs give out partly after being deprived of bloodflow for so long. Dizziness hits as the blood in your body desparately tries to keep up with your sudden movement. As you regain your senses, you check the time again; It's 4 am. You sigh. "<i>Not again</i>." Whilst brushing your teeth, you contemplate putting off sleeping until tomorrow. This thought leads you to contemplating your life and life choices. As you wallow in the meaninglessness of life, a spark flickers past your train of thought. You leave the train and chase after it. "<i>What was it again</i>?" The spark lingers on the tip of your brain's imaginary tongue. A small memory; A short moment in your long life. You finally catch it. It was a comment in a random part of the internet. It was something truly worthless, but you can't help but think about it. You want to forget. You want to think of something, anything, else. You try to bury it, but your mind screams "don't let yourself distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table."</p>
